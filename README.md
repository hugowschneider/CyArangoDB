# CyArangoDB


# JFlex

`src/main/flex/ArangoTokenMaker.flex` generates a class that splits up text into tokens representing ArangoDB's AQL query syntax.

 If you wish to regenerate this file yourself, keep in mind the following:
 
- The generated `AqlTokenMaker.java` file will
    contain two definitions of both `zzRefill` and
    `yyreset`.  You should hand-delete the second of each
    definition (the ones generated by the lexer), as these generated
    methods modify the input buffer, which we'll never have to do.

- You should also change the declaration/definition of zzBuffer to NOT
    be initialized.  This is a needless memory allocation for us since we
    will be pointing the array somewhere else anyway.

- You should NOT call `yylex()` on the generated scanner
    directly; rather, you should use `getTokenList` as you would
    with any other `TokenMaker` instance.
